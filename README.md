# 2D-Minecraft-CE
A 2D Minecraft clone for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator. Check out here: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15243&amp;start=80  for more information.

To build, grab the ICE Compiler py PT_ from github or cemetech.net. Run the compiler and select MCLITESC, which is the source program.
To run the pre-built version, run MCLITE from the PRGM menu or from your favorite shell!

Controls:
    In menus:
- Arrow keys - Move cursor
- [y=]-[graph] - Only function on certain menus, where extra controls are shown in gray on bottom part of the screen
- [enter] - select choice
- [clear] - exit the menu, cancel selection

    In-game Inventory Controls are same as in menus, with few exceptions:
    Furnaces are usable, but RAM resets usually happen! The furnaces will be updated soon! 

    In-game:
- Arrow keys - move player
- [2nd] - Inventory
- [del] - delete block
- [alpha], [stat], [mode], [apps] - Block cursor.
- [prgm] - Chat (not added yet, as of BETA v4.0.0, reason in Changelog)
- [clear] - Quit game. 

Changelog:

    - v4.0.0 LITE
       - New and improved GUI. Controls updated.
       - Simple *LITE* version, which includes 4 different world sizes, 40x40, 60x60, 70x80, 80x90
       - No player skins are added in the world, and will be added shortly
       - A few bugs exist, and if a RAM Reset occurred, a message will automatically display 'Global Resources Reset'. This reloads all appvars the next time you enter the game.
       - Multiplayer menu is implemented, now just waiting for the USB Driver support in ICE.
       - A few more features that might be fixed or changed soon...
