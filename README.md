A 2D Minecraft clone for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator. Check out here: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15243&amp;start=80  for more information.

    In menus:
- Arrow keys - Move cursor

    - v1.3.7 unreleased will have these *new* features:
-External Texture Pack support - You will be able to get premium texture packs from me once it is released...
- List of texture packs are added in the STORE.
- Skins Packs will also be available, given you follow the rules to earn them (below)
- Options menu added - you will also be able to set Super-Secret Settings, which I will make COMPLETELY different from the real Minecraft

RULES TO EARN STORE ITEMS:
Once 1.3.7 is fully released, the store will be added. So with that, new features and items will be added.
To earn a texture pack, you will need a screenshot of you earning the achievment 'EARN A STORE ITEM'. That applies for skin packs, too!
