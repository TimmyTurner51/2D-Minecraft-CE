# 2D-Minecraft-CE
A 2D Minecraft clone for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator. Check out here: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15243&amp;start=80  for more information.

To build, grab the ICE Compiler py PT_ from github or cemetech.net. Run the compiler and select MCLITESC, which is the source program.
To run the pre-built version, run MCLITE from the PRGM menu or from your favorite shell!

Controls:
    In menus:
- Arrow keys - Move cursor
- [y=]-[graph] - Only function on certain menus, where extra controls are shown in gray on bottom part of the screen
- [enter] - select choice
- [clear] - exit the menu, cancel selection

    In-game Inventory Controls are same as in menus, with few exceptions:
    Furnaces are usable, but RAM resets usually happen! The furnaces will be updated soon! 

    In-game:
- Arrow keys - move player
- [2nd] - Inventory
- [del] - delete block
- [alpha], [stat], [mode], [apps] - Block cursor.
- [prgm] - Chat (not added yet, as of BETA v4.0.0)
- [clear] - Quit game. 

Changelog:

    - v4.0.0.001 LITE
       - New and improved GUI. Controls updated.
       - Simple *LITE* version, which includes 4 different world sizes, 40x40, 60x60, 70x80, 80x90 (causes calc to freeze, so don't use it!)
       - Player skins are added in worlds
       - World Name saved properly, so you can see your world's name in the PLAY menu.
       - Texture Packs list is updated and fixed, so no more corrupted, glitchy names and texture pack icons!
       - A few bugs were fixed, but if a RAM Reset occurred, a message will automatically display 'Global Resources Reset'. This reloads all appvars the next time you enter the game.
       - Multiplayer menu is implemented, now just waiting for the USB Driver support in ICE.
       - There are a few more features that might be fixed or changed soon...

CREDITS:
- All thanks goes to the whole cemetech community.
- LogicalJoe - Provided Texture Packs and the MINECRAFT logo. Also, LogicalJoe is my modivation to finish this project.
- Beckadamtheinventor - Provided his version of the MINECRAFT logo. This logo was used in one version of Minecraft, but that logo appvar was removed unfortunately. I do appreciate the help from him. However, LogicalJoe's logo was accepted because I do not want to use a game's full name from a platform, like Pocket Edition.
- There are so many programmers who have helped. I'd you to check them out in my development forum: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15243&start=120
