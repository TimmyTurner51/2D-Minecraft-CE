This is the source code folder to BETA v4.0.01. Backup all RAM before executing


BUGS:
  - There are not that many noticeable bugs, except for one:
    - When in a World, entering the Inventory is fine (SEE UNDER INVENTORY), but when exiting the Inventory, you will
    notice that some parts of the world is removed (one layer is replaced with air). I cannot find why this bug is
    there, and there is NO CODE telling Minecraft CE to delete parts of the world
    
    
INVENTORY
  - This Inventory is different than the Inventory in the compiled Minecraft I provided. Since that upload, lots of bugs
  ARE FIXED! This inventory is based from Minecraft PS3 Edition in a way. The version of the menu is v1.5.0, which is not
  important
  
  Please support me here if you find a fix to the world bug: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15243&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=120
